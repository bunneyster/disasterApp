<h2><%= @product %> Terms of Service</h2>

<p>Posted: <%= @posted %></p>
<p>Effective: <%= @effective %></p>

<p>
Thanks for using <%= @product %>! These terms of service ("Terms") cover your
use and access to the services, client software and websites ("Services")
provided by <%= @product %>.
Our
<%= link_to 'Privacy Policy', legal_url(document: :privacy) %>
explains how we collect and use your information while our
<%= link_to 'Acceptable Use Policy', legal_url(document: :aup) %>
outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our
Services, you're agreeing to be bound by these Terms, and to review our
<%= link_to 'Privacy', legal_url(document: :privacy) %>
and
<%= link_to 'Acceptable Use', legal_url(document: :aup) %>
policies.
If you're using our Services for an organization, you're agreeing to these
Terms on behalf of that organization.


<h3>Your Stuff & Your Permissions</h3>

<p>
When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content,
email messages, contacts and so on ("Your Stuff").
Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don't give us any rights to Your Stuff except
for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.
</p>

<p>
We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up,
and sharing it when you ask us to.
Our Services also provide you with features like photo thumbnails, document
previews, email organization, easy sorting, editing, sharing and searching.
These and other features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your
Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends
to trusted third parties we work with.
</p>

<h3>Sharing Your Stuff</h3>

<p>
Our Services let you share Your Stuff with others, so please think carefully
about what you share.
</p>

<h3>Your Responsibilities</h3>

<p>
You're responsible for your conduct, Your Stuff and you must comply with our
<%= link_to 'Acceptable Use Policy', legal_url(document: :aup) %>.
Content in the Services may be protected by others' intellectual property
rights.
Please don't copy, upload, download or share content unless you have the right
to do so.
</p>

<p>
We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our
<%= link_to 'Acceptable Use Policy', legal_url(document: :aup) %>
With that said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren't responsible for the
content people post and share via the Services.
</p>

<p>
Please safeguard your password to the Services, make sure that others don't
have access to it, and keep your account information current.
</p>

<p>
Finally, our Services are not intended for and may not be used by people under
the age of 13. By using our Services, you are representing to us that you're
over 13.
</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>
Some of our Services allow you to download client software
("Software") which may update automatically.
So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive,
nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the
Services.
To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source
license, we'll make that license available to you and the provisions of that
license may expressly override some of these Terms.
Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to
reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone
in doing so.
</p>

<h3>Our Stuff</h3>

<p>
The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and
foreign laws.
These Terms don't grant you any right, title or interest in the
Services, others' content in the Services, <%= @product %> trademarks, logos
and other brand features.
We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or
suggestions without any obligation to you.
</p>

<h3>Copyright</h3>
<p>
We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too.
We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the
law, and such notices should be reported using our
<%= link_to 'DMCA Process', legal_url(document: :dmca) %>.
We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and
terminate accounts of repeat infringers.
Our designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement on the
Services is: <%= @dmca_email %>
</p>

<h3>Paid Accounts</h3>

<p>
<em>Billing.</em>
You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account
(turning your account into a "Paid Account").
We'll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on
each periodic renewal until cancellation. You're responsible for all applicable
taxes, and we'll charge tax when required to do so.
</p>

<p>
<em>No Refunds.</em>
You may cancel your <%= @product %> Paid Account at any time but you won't be
issued a refund.
</p>

<p>
<em>Downgrades.</em>
Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated
under these Terms. If you don't pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve
the right to suspend it or reduce your storage to free space levels.
</p>

<p>
<em>Changes.</em>
We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these
changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.
</p>

<h3>Termination</h3>

<p>
You're free to stop using our Services at any time.
We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our
discretion and without notice.
For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if you're not
complying with these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us
legal liability, disrupt the Services or disrupt others' use of the Services.
Except for Paid Accounts, we reserve the right to terminate and delete your
account if you haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.
We'll of course provide you with notice via the email address associated with
your account before we do so.
</p>

<h3>Services "AS IS"</h3>

<p>
We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain
things that we can't guarantee.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, <%= @product.upcase %> AND ITS
AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES.
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS."
WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
Some states don't allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not
apply to you.
</p>

<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>

<p>
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
<%= @product.upcase %>, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR
(A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL
THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT <%= @product.upcase %> HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL
PURPOSE;
(B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE
GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO <%= @product.upcase %> FOR THE
PAST 12 MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION.
Some states don't allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may
not apply to you.
</p>

<h3>Resolving Disputes</h3>

<p>
<em>Let's Try To Sort Things Out First.</em>
We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.
Before filing a claim against <%= @product %>, you agree to try to resolve the
dispute informally by contacting <%= @dispute_email %>.
We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email.
If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or
<%= @product %> may bring a formal proceeding.
</p>

<p>
<em>We Both Agree To Arbitrate.</em>
You and <%= @product %> agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or
the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under
Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
</p>

<p>
<em>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.</em>
You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and submitting
the opt-out form within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.
</p>

<p>
<em>Arbitration Procedures.</em>
The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration
under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for
Consumer Related Disputes.
The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or
work, <%= @court_location %>, or any other location we agree to.
</p>

<p>
<em>Arbitration Fees and Incentives.</em>
The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. <%= @product %> will
pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000.
If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we
make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award.
<%= @product %> will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration
unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
</p>

<p>
<em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</em>
Either you or <%= @product %> may assert claims, if they qualify, in small
claims court in <%= @court_location %> or any United States county where you
live or work.
Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop
unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property
infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent
rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal
dispute-resolution process described above.
</p>

<p>
<em>No Class Actions.</em>
You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring
a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or
representative action.
Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and
consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed.
</p>

<p>
<em>Judicial forum for disputes.</em>
In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or
your claim, you and <%= @product %> agree that any judicial proceeding (other
than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of
<%= @court_location %>.
Both you and <%= @product %> consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.
</p>

<h3>Controlling Law</h3>

<p>
These Terms will be governed by <%= @law_source %> law except for its conflicts
of laws principles.
</p>

<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>

<p>
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and <%= @product %>
with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace
any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions
applicable to the subject matter of these Terms.
These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.
</p>

<h3>Waiver, Severability & Assignment</h3>

<p>
<%= @product %>'s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right
to do so later.
If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms
will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted
reflecting our intent as closely as possible.
You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt
will be void.
<%= @product %> may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries,
or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
</p>

<h3>Modifications</h3>

<p>
We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most
current version on our website.
If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for
example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account,
posting on our blog or on this page).
By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into
effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
</p>
