<p>Effective: <%= @effective %></p>

<p>
Thanks for using <%= @product %>! Here we describe how we collect, use and
handle your information when you use our websites, software and services
("Services").
</p>

<h3>What & Why</h3>

<p>
We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect
our Services:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Account.</em>
We collect, and associate with your account, information like your name, email
address, phone number, payment info, and physical address.
Some of our services let you access your accounts and your information with
other service providers.
</li>

<li>
<em>Services.</em>
When you use our Services, we store, process and transmit your files (including
stuff like your photos, structured data and emails) and information related to
them (for example, location tags in photos).
If you give us access to your contacts, we'll store those contacts on our
servers for you to use.
This will make it easy for you to do things like share your stuff, send emails,
and invite others to use the Services.
</li>

<li>
<em>Usage.</em>
We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the
Services.
This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use,
the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated
with your devices.
Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location
information to the Services.
</li>

<li>
<em>Cookies and other technologies.</em>
We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect
and promote our Services.
For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for
your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and
improving them based on that information.
You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability
to use the Services.
If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we'll respond to that
signal as outlined here.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>With whom</h3>

<li>
<em>Others working for <%= @product %>.</em>

behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
</li>

<em>Other users.</em>
Our Services display information like your name and email address to other
users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications.
Certain features let you make additional information available to other users.

(d) protect <%= @product %>'s property rights.

<p>
Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we
embrace. We believe that our users' data should receive the same legal
protections regardless of whether it's stored on our services or on their home
computer's hard drive. We'll abide by the following Government Request

for our users' data:

<h3>How</h3>

<p>
<em>Security.</em>
We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for
vulnerabilities.
We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition
to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and
alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account.
</p>

<p>
<em>Retention.</em>
We'll retain information you store on our Services for as long as we need it to
provide you the Services.
If you delete your account, we'll also delete this information.
But please note:
(1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers
and back-up storage; and
(2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal
obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.
</p>


<h3>Where</h3>

<p>
<em>Around the world.</em>
To provide you with the Services, we may store, process and transmit
information in locations around the world - including those outside your
country. Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to
access the Services.
</p>

<p>
<em>Safe Harbor.</em>
<%= @product %> complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Safe Harbor ("Safe
Harbor") frameworks and principles.
</p>


<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>
If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our
assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will
notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with
your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.
</p>

<p>
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most
current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights,
we will notify you.
